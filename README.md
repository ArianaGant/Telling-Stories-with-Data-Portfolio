# About me
Hi! My name is Ariana (she/her) and I'm a Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I have a bachelor's degree in Business Management with minors in Theatre and Dance. I aspire to work for a large regional performing arts organization, preferably in marketing or education. 

# What I hope to learn
Data is an important tool in conveying the impact of art. I look forward to learning how to create effective vizualizations that are both aesthetically pleasing and effective. I see myself primarily using these skills to create annual reports and similar materials.
