# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My audience is people living in New Mexico. It's hard to describe just how important green chile is to New Mexican culture, so a title like "Do you like green chile?"

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Educate my audience about the Rio Grande Ecosystem     | Do my connections between topics make sense?                 |

| Successfully tie data together to tell a story | Does the data that I'm visualizing further my arguement?                 |
| "     | Do these visualizations make sense for the data they're displaying? | 
| Create a visually appealing product | What do you like most? |
| "     | What would you suggest changing? |
