# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User Research 

## Target Audience

My audience is people living in New Mexico. It's hard to describe just how important green chile is to New Mexican culture, so a title like "Do you like green chile?" is highly likely to draw in my intended audience. Ultimately, I plan for my call to action to address both every-day people and legislators alike, all of which who love green chile. There are plenty of other crops that I could have chosen, but it's really the people living in New Mexico that can make a difference, so I decided to chose a niche vegetable targeting them specifically.

None of the people I asked to review my product are from New Mexico, so I asked them to pretend that they do know and love green chile.

## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Educate my audience about the Rio Grande Ecosystem     | Do my connections between topics make sense?                 |
| "     | Are there other topics that would positively contribute to the narrative?                 |
| Successfully tie data together to tell a story | Does the data that I'm visualizing further my arguement?                 |
| "     | Do these visualizations make sense for the data they're displaying? | 
| Create a visually appealing product | What do you like most? |
| "     | What would you suggest changing? |

# Identified Changes for Part III

| Research Synthesis                       | Anticipated Changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I find myself wanting to create a Sankey Graph again and again but it might not be the best option here.  | Given the way the shorthand is set up, having one pictograph melt into another is probably going to be more visually impactful when depicting the percentage of green chile grown in New Mexico and then watered by the Rio Grande. | 
| It was suggested to have a visualization to wrap it all up. | If I can swing it, I'll try to make a web-of-life type of graph. |
| An issue I'm running into is that water quality changes at different points along the river and it's a huge river. | I'll likely have to put in a little note saying as much. |
| It might be nice to show where the fish and crops are.| If I can, I'd love to make some maps showing Silvery Minnow range and areas where Green Chile is grown throughout New Mexico.|
