# Final Project Part I

### New Mexicans: Do you like Green Chile?
### Then you should care about the Silvery Minnow

Green Chile Peppers (aka New Mexico, Red, or Hatch Chile) are staples in the New Mexican diet. Enchiladas, burritos, quesadillas, pizza, hamburgers, and more would all be incomplete without the state vegetable. These peppers are primarily grown in New Mexico, with some cultivation in California and Texas. Of the crops grown in New Mexico, the vast majority are irrigated by the Rio Grande. (green chile pic)

The Rio Grande is a river stretching from Colorado, through central New Mexico, and south to serve as the border between Texas and Mexico before letting out into the Gulf of Mexico. The river is absolutely vital to New Mexico, providing freshwater for agriculture, wildlife, and more. Over time, the river has faced a number of challenges, including pollution, man-made dams, climate change, and drought. I lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico from 2000-2018 and during that time, the stretch of the Rio Grande running through the city was almost always dry. (add map)

Aside from water level, an indicator of the health of the Rio Grande is the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus). The Silvery Minnow has suffered in light of the challenges facing the Rio Grande and was officially classified as endangered in 1994. Consequently detailed records have been kept of the fish’s population since then. Described as a “canary in a coal mine”, direct correlation can be seen between Silvery Minnow populations and river health, offering a clear visualization of the Rio Grande being in trouble. (add fish pic)

To connect it all, New Mexicans care deeply about the Green Chile industry, which is completely reliant on the state of the Rio Grande, whose health can be demonstrated by the state of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow population.

## Outline

1. Green chile background- visualizing how much of the chile industry comes from NM
2. Why the Rio Grande is important to the crop - how much chile is grown in NM -> how much of that chile is watered by the Rio Grande
3. The history of the river - visualizations about water level & pollution levels 
4. How the Silvery Minnow mirrors the health of the river - population compared to river indicators 
5. What everyday people and legislators can do to help the river & minnows and ensure that we never run out of green chile

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

I’ll be using the United States Department of Agriculture and the New Mexico Migrant Education Program Agriculture Review documents for data on the green chile industry. There are a couple measurements I could use but I think I’ll show how much of all green chile production is from New Mexico. Since my audience is New Mexicans, I don’t think that I need to stress the importance of green chile or how big the industry is- they already know. The story I’m trying to tell is that the Rio Grande being in trouble means that green chile is also in trouble.

My USGS document about water withdrawal will help me to establish how much of the green chile grown in NM is watered by the Rio Grande and directly impacted by the state of the river. I want people to know that 60% (or whatever it is) of the green chile pool is directly at the mercy of the river. 

The USGS data set about the Rio Grande offers data on both the level of water and what’s in the water. I plan to use it to show trends in water level and quality. Then I’ll use the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation document to overlay Silvery Minnow population over the river indicators. 

## Method and medium

I plan to use Shorthand to showcase my final story and Tableau and/or Data Wrapper to create my visualizations.
