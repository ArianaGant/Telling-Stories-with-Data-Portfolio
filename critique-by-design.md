# Water World
## A Critique by Design

## The Original Vizualization 

<img src="Water World.png" align=left width="600"/>

I chose this vizualization becuase it has some elements in its favor, including visual aesthetics and an interesting subject. However, it also has plenty of room for improvement, with a design that's not immediately intuitive.

## The Critique
### Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't work well?

- Although quite pretty, it took me a long time to understand what I was looking at. Once I looked at it for a while it made plenty of sense but it wasn’t immediately intuitive.
- The grey ovals representing the different layers get confused with the lines stemming out to the three largest categories (oceans, salt groundwater, and freshwater). Consequently, despite the colors, it took me a bit longer than is preferable to understand the layering.
- There’s not much to tell me what I should be gathering from this visualization. It’s certainly possible that there’s more in the book it came from (“Knowledge is Beautiful”), but I don’t have it here. I’m guessing, given the white circles, that he wants us to head through the layers to ultimately see how humans are using water. If so though, why did he include the organisms?
- None of the items are in any particular order within their categories. Nothing is sorted by size, alphabet, or anything else.
- The data is both wrong and misleading. More details below.
-It really is quite aesthetic. The colors are pretty, it’s a unique visualization, I like the concept of the layers, and I like how dots are (kind of) proportional to percentage.

## What's wrong with the data?
- The visualization says that 0.03% of freshwater is found in organisms, but the spreadsheet says it’s actually only 0.003%.
- Saltwater lakes are left completely off the visualization even though they account for a larger percentage of water than multiple other sources.
- The implication is that each colored layer adds up to 100% of the water source they stem from. None of them (with the exception of the largest, blue layer) do. Normally these rounding errors wouldn’t be completely egregious, except for the fact that some of the categories are as small as 0.01%. They are as follows:
1. Types of Freshwater: 100.36%
2. Water in Organisms: 101.6%
3. Water Used by Humans: 101%
- The organism and used by humans data are from separate data sets than the higher layers. 
- The organism data set appears to be cobbled together from various sources. 
- I can’t find the used by humans data set. The link doesn't work and I can’t find it online.
- It’s visually unclear if water used by humans is 0.03% of all freshwater, or just 0.3% of the combination of lakes, rivers, and groundwater. 

### Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?

- I think this is for people who love a good visualization, who like to learn new things, and who love data. Maybe people who like to tell their friends at trivia night that 35% of the water in all organisms can be found in insects.
- The visualization comes from a book called “Knowledge is Beautiful” by David McCandless, a book apparently full of infographics and visualizations on many categories like science, power, money, health, space, art, thought, and dogs. Clearly it’s not for the everyday public. People seeing this design likely have a bit of experience viewing data visualizations already, which maybe forgives the initially confusing nature of the visualization a bit.
- McCandless certainly supports the thesis of the book that information is beautiful. However, I think his use of the data itself could be improved upon based on the data inconsistencies. 

### Based on your critique, what do you think you'll try to focus on in your redesign?   Any ideas or inspiration for how you can make a better data visualization?  What are you excited to try next?

- I’m thinking of changing the visualization form to an Alluvial Diagram. I hope that changing the format will eliminate some of my original visual confusion. 
- I worry about the data. There is so much data clean-up that needs to be done on these provided spreadsheets that I’m considering not using the organism and used by human data at all. 
- McCandless is a professional at information design and he says he spent 15,832 hours (1.81 years) working on this book. In all that time, isn’t it likely that he exhausted all the other options for type of visualization for this data? Why didn’t he use a more immediately intuitive format? Purely aesthetics? I’m not sure but in my mind’s eye, an Alluvial Diagram will look nicer.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
